Description:

1.Home.html:

This is the Home Page of the Project, It is the center from where you can navigate to all other Elevations. This page has The 3-dimensional 
object of the house for which we are making different elevations.The 3d object is interactive
in some ways, to open and close the door Click on the door, to open and close the window click
on the window. This page has 3 links to it to go to Front view, Top View and Side view
of the Dream House. 

2.House.html:

This is a Html page showing the front 2-dimensional front view of the 3-dimensional house which we showed before in the home. This is a static projection.
you can navigate to other views by the navigation provided in the page.

3.Top view.html

This is a Html page showing the front 2-dimensional Top view of the 3-dimensional house which we showed before in the home. This is a static projection.
you can navigate to other views by the navigation provided in the page.

4.Side view.html

This is a Html page showing the front 2-dimensional side view of the 3-dimensional house which we showed before in the home. This is a static projection.
you can navigate to other views by the navigation provided in the page.

REPORT:

1) From this work, I gained the perspective on how to develop 3-Dimensional objects which is not easy to implement like 2-dimesnional objects.
I understood that A 3-d object is formed by elevating multiple 2-d objects. From this knowledge i gained, i feel i can implement 3-Dimensional objects
in the upcoming weeks of the project as creating the elevations of that object made me know where the vertices are and how to transform it into the vertices of a 3d
object.

2) I am going to develop my project using web-gl, i am going to create any 3-dimesnional object and will perform different transformations on it like rotate, shear, 
move etc. I hope at the end of this project i will be able to create a scene with motion 3d objects.

Description:

1.fractal.html:

This html file contains four radio buttons, one for drawing a line fractal,  one for drawing a triangle fractal,one for drawing
an Arc fractal and one for drawing a square fractal. upon selecting any radio button the user have to give impute two parameters in the number boxes given those are ratio of the primitive
to be fractalized and the number of iterations it should be doing. I implemented the interface in such a way that in the ratio box instead of giving  a p/q form you can just give a whole 
number and it will inherently convert it in to 1/the number you gave as the input. for example if you enter 2 in the ratio number box it will be taken as 1/2 in the program. Then, 
i Have implemented additional features which are optional like border width and color. after selecting all the things mentioned so far you can press the button draw which will execute
the whole program and the output will be visible on the canvas. You can use clear button at any point of time to clear the canvas. some times you may see some irregularities in the canvas 
at that time just press clear nd everything will be alright.

2.driver.html:

This html file contains 4 number boxes for the user to give input: 
1) X-coordinate ( the starting point with respect to x in the canvas)
2) y-coordinate(the starting point with respect to y in the canvas)
3)radius( the radius of the wheel)
4) score ( the score of the driver)

after entering the 4 inputs in the number boxes given, you can optionally select the border
width and the color.

The next step is to press the button draw to see the output on the canvas. you will get the output
depending on the score you entered. if it is 100 you will get a circular wheel, if the score entered
is between 91 and 99 you will get an ellipse and if the score is less than 80 or equal to 80 then 
you will get a polygon with sides as the number of sides equal to the score.
you can use clear button to clear the canvas.
